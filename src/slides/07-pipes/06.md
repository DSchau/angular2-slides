## Using our custom pipe

A pipe must be declared

```typescript
import { PeopleYearsPipe } from './people-years.pipe';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    DogDetailComponent, PeopleYearsPipe
  ],
  imports: [],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [DogDetailComponent]
})
export class DogDetailModule { }
```
