## Considerations

* Child Injectors
* Dependency duplication
* Loading Strategy

<aside class="notes">
Lazy-loaded modules get their own injector instance. Once an injector has been used, it cannot be modified. A 
lazy-loaded module may add new dependencies, so they go into a new injector.

A lazy-loaded module is bundled with all of the dependencies that it thinks it needs. If multiple lazy-loaded modules 
depend on the same thing, then that dependency might need moved into a core functionality.

Do you want to lazy-load on demand, pre-load, or default load.
